  title: Credal Probabilistic Circuits
  abstract: Probabilistic Circuits (PCs) are versatile models that encode a joint probability distribution with the use of a discrete latent space. They allow for tractable computations of multiple types of queries. Credal PCs extend PCs by allowing the specification of convex sets of parameters, thus representing a set of PCs sharing the same structure. They have been shown useful in the analysis of robustness of inferences, treatment of complicated missing data, and improvement of privacy. We look at their capabilities for large-scale uncertainty treatment, discussing model properties and algorithms. Finally, we dive into the possibility of extending these models to leverage continuous latent spaces.

  title: Structured and Unstructured Sparsity in Probabilistic Neurosymbolic AI
  abstract: In order to perform learning, data has to exhibit a certain degree of sparsity. In neurosymbolic AI this sparsity is expressed explicitly via formal languages. In this talk I will  sketch how such sparsity can be exploited efficiently using modern AI hardware in the context of probabilistic neurosymbolic AI.
