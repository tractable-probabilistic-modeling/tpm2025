# Call for Papers
We invite three types of submissions:

1. **Novel research** on tractable probabilistic modeling
2. **Retrospective papers** discussing the impact, consequences, and lessons learned
3. **Recently accepted papers** on tractable probabilistic modeling (_in the original format and length_)

## Topics of interest

Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

* New tractable representations in logical, continuous, and hybrid domains
* Learning algorithms for TPMs
* Theoretical and empirical analysis of TPMs
* Connections between TPM classes
* TPMs for responsible, robust, and explainable AI
* TPMs for trustworthy ML
* Approximate inference algorithms with guarantees
* Successful applications of TPMs to real-world problems

## Submission Instructions
Original papers and retrospective papers are required to follow the style guidelines of UAI and should use the adjusted template [TPM format](/tpm2024/assets/tpm2024-template.zip). 
Submitted papers should be **up to 4 pages long**, excluding references. 
Already accepted papers can be submitted in the format of the venue they have been accepted to. 
Supplementary material can be put in the same pdf paper (after references); it is entirely up to the reviewers to decide whether they wish to consult this additional material.

All submissions must be electronic (through the link below), and must closely follow the formatting guidelines in the templates, otherwise, they will automatically be rejected. 
Reviewing for TPM is single-blind; i.e., reviewers will know the authorsâ€™ identity but authors won't know the reviewers' identity. 
However, we recommend that you refer to your prior work in the third person wherever possible. 
We also encourage links to public repositories such as GitHub to share code and/or data.

For any questions, please contact us at: [tpmworkshop2024@gmail.com](mailto:tpmworkshop2024@gmail.com)

**Submission using:** [OpenReview](https://openreview.net/group?id=auai.org/UAI/2024/Workshop/TPM).

_**Note:** New OpenReview profiles created without an institutional email will go through a moderation process that can take up to two weeks. OpenReview profiles created with an institutional email will be activated automatically._
